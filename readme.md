## Page Builder

The core concept of Layers is to enable the user to build layouts using functionality that is native to WordPress. This page template simply provides a single widget area that is designed to work with the Layers Page Builder Widgets specifically, but can accomodate most any widget with a little custom styling.

[Learn how the page builder works](http://docs.layerswp.com/doc/build-your-home-page/)

## Page Templates

Layers bundles 6 basic page templates to allow sidebar specificity per page, and a standard blog feed which uses the Layers Site Settings sidebar selection.

## Framework

Layers is built upon a lightweight HTML5 & CSS framework designed for speed, comprehension and efficient building of Child Themes and Extensions. It uses a 12ths grid and includes styling for buttons, forms, content typography, navigation and images.

### Code Libraries & APIs

Layers uses jQuery, JSON, and other libraries pre-bundled with the WordPress platform which you can reference on the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script#Default_Scripts_Included_and_Registered_by_WordPress).

Additionally, Layers includes [Swiper](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/get-started/) which you can learn more about extending and cusomizing through their API documentation as part of your child theme or extension.

## Theming & Extending

As a framework, Layers is not intended for direct modification. Instead, it allows you to backup pages and widget data to create presets or Style Kits which you can share, sell, or use to seamlessly transfer setups and layouts from one install to another. Layers may also be extended through Child Themes and Plugins (Extensions) via a growing set of hooks, snippets and tips found in our Developer Reference library.

The Layers Docs codex contains a growing reference for custom hooks found in Layers, along with core functions, definitions and child-theming resources.
